Goal: Review branch {{.BranchName}} against {{.TargetBranch}} and report any issues.

Steps:
1. The branch {{.BranchName}} is already checked out.
2. Here is the diff against {{.TargetBranch}} (full diff plus stats):

{{.Diff}}

3. Review the diff for functional correctness and ensure there are no bugs.
4. Ensure the code uses the DRY principle.
5. Summarize findings and open questions.
6. Save the review as a markdown file at: {{.ReviewFilePath}}

Deliverable:
- Findings first, ordered by severity, with 'path:line' references.
- Note any assumptions or questions.
- End with an easy-to-read summary section.
- Add a human readable summary of what has changed.
